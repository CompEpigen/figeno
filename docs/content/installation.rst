Installation
==================================

    
Linux, MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash
	
	pip install figeno


Windows
^^^^^^^

Figeno has some dependencies which do not officially support Windows (pysam, pybigwig), so it is difficult to install as a python package on Windows. To make it easier for windows users to use figeno, we provide windows binaries for figeno. Download figeno_windows.zip from https://github.com/CompEpigen/figeno/releases/latest, extract it, and start the figeno GUI by double-clicking on figene.exe.
